This is a C implementation of the ``guess the animal'' game.
It uses curses(3X) for the user interface and standard buffered
I/O routines for the file interface.

This version of the program has been ported to a Sun running BSD,
System 5.3 on a VAX, Interactive's 386/ix port of System 5.3 and
VX/VE System 5.2 running on a CDC Cyber.

An example file is included with the source and can be used by
the command:

$ animal example

The program will look the best on System 5.3 Unix, and the
worst on BSD.  I'll fix any bugs people have, I don't
consider the BSD curses library routines to be bugs per se
(so don't complain to me about them).

The first time I ever saw this game was on an ancient DECUS
tape, it was a FORTRAN implementation.  Since then I have
written a VAX Pascal version (1983), a C64 Basic version (1982),
and a VMS DCL version (1985) (recently posted to alt.sources).

PLEASE: take time to edit the Makefile for your machine.
Before you go rushing off to post on the net complaining
that something doesn't work make some attempt to fix the
problem yourself, it may even be your fault!
